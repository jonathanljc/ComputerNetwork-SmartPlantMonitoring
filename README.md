# 🌱 Smart Plant Monitoring System

## 📄 Project Overview
The **Smart Plant Monitoring System** is an IoT-based project developed for **INF1006 Computer Networks**. It uses **Raspberry Pi 4**, **MQTT**, and **Node-RED** to monitor and control environmental conditions for plants. The system provides real-time data via a **web dashboard** and allows automated actions like watering and controlling LED light intensity.

## 🔧 System Features

### 🛠 Monitoring
- **Soil Moisture Level**  
- **UV Light Intensity**  
- **Temperature & Humidity**
- **Water Tank Level**  

### 💡 Dashboard
- Real-time monitoring via Node-RED web dashboard.  
- Perform automated actions such as:
  - **Watering plants** using a submersible pump.  
  - **Controlling light intensity** using LEDs.

## 📁 Project Structure
The project contains two key components:

1. **Broker**:
   - Runs the **Mosquitto MQTT broker** to manage communication between devices.
   - Includes the Node-RED server for real-time visualization.

2. **Client**:
   - Two separate clients, **Client A** and **Client B**, running on Raspberry Pis:
     - **Client A** (`piClient1.py`): Handles soil moisture and ultrasonic sensors.
     - **Client B** (`piClient2.py`): Handles temperature, humidity, and UV light sensors.
